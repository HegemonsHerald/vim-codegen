- make the switch use SnippetIterateWhile, the quit-on-empty-enter is just sooo much neater, than the endless re-asking 'do you want to continue?'

- primitive codegens: constants, the prompt-visibility variants, methods, constructors, for loops, while loops

- jdoc codegens
   - move method jdoc into functions
   - make method jdoc take it's input as an argument
       --> then you can just pass a constructor off as a method by removing public and adding 'void'!
           (if you really want a special type, have it be name instead of 'void' and add checking functionality for this case...)
   - constants (<-- oneliners), classes and interfaces, constructors
   - identifier function
   - proper config for Inserter...

- addIfNotThere functionality and globalized dictionairies for the type prompt
